# 3D-modeling---Animation-Project-4
Project requirements

Please make a treadmill model
We will need two interactive buttons in Unity a start and a stop button. All other buttons could be only textured
Make sure you use the shaders and texture tool to present the differen layers of the belt and the edges, etc.
Please finish texturing the barbells you made for project 2 or project 3. Make sure you will use the shaders to show the bumps on the weights and the bars.
Or you could do your models with similar works covering all of the requirements above. If you have any question, please ask me.
